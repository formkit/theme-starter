  The text family of inputs all have very similar underlying FormKit schemas, so
  it is very likely that you'll be able to do 90% of your required styling within this
  "family:text" group. However, scaffolding for each input within the text family
  is provided within this file so that you can override individual inputs if needed.

  Some inputs within the family such as `color`, `file`, `mask (Pro)`, and `range` will 
  required their own additional consideration within your theme.
